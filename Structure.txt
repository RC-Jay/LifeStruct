What does Structure.io do? 
It gives the privilege of structure to everybody.

Here are some features of structure.io :

1. Automatic Agenda Generation

  What does this even mean?
  Something like this:

    Hey Vinay, here's how your day looks like:
      1 hour on A
      2 hours on B
      3 hours on C
      1 hour on D

    Suggested schedule:
      2-4 PM: Do this
      5-6 PM: Do that

    Keep in mind that the actual times can be rearranged, to
    make it more flexible.

    Logging has a 'task' option which adds a log as a task.
    This is the only way to check off a task.
    So log and log often.

    All Goals have a 'Amount of Hours' field and a date
    to be accomplished by.

    Goals have a hierarchy too -- Basically to-dos
    full fledge to become goals.

    To check off a goal/task, you need to log it.

    Logging however can be done for other things as well.
    Just think of it as another parameter of hash.

    A day constitutes 24 hours and it has to be done by that
    time spot.

    Repetition needs to be added for certain tasks/to-dos/goals

2. Let's talk input:
-- Add new task/goal/creating subtrees
-- Logging obviously

3. As now recorded in my notebook:

4 panels.
  1: Displaying of scheduling of tasks/goals
  2: Adding tasks/goals
  3: Logging
  4: Thoughts and ideas
